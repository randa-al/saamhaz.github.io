  I'm founder and GP of <a href="https://volt.capital">Volt Capital</a> a venture fund based in San Francisco that focuses on pre-seed and seed companies in the digital assets space.
  Before starting Volt Capital, I launched <a href="https://www.tokendaily.co/">Token Daily</a>, a community of 20K+ builders, investors, and talent in the crypto space.
  TD community members have gone on to raise from USV, a16z Crypto, Lightspeed, and other great firms.
  Iâ€™m an advisor to <a href="https://www.beondeck.com/">On Deck</a> and was a mentor at <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/12/11/announcing-crypto-startup-school-instructors/">the Andreessen Horowitz crypto startup school</a>.
  Before joining the venture side of things, I was the 20th hire at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/17/alation-announces-50m-series-c-investment-as-data-catalog-biz-takes-off/">Alation</a> which closed its Series C in 2019 led by Sapphire Ventures and Salesforce.
  I hail from the University of Michigan School of Engineering. Go blue!
